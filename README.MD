# Animal Similarity using Word2Vec

This Python script uses the Gensim library and Word2Vec model to find similar animals based on their names. The script reads animal names from an input JSON file, trains a Word2Vec model on the animal names, and saves the most similar animals for each animal in the list to a new JSON file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or newer
- Gensim library

## Installation

1. Install Python 3.7 or newer from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Install the Gensim library:

```bash
pip install gensim
